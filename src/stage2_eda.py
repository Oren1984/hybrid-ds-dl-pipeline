# src/stage2_eda.py
# This script is responsible for performing quick exploratory data analysis (EDA).
# For now, it's a placeholder that indicates where EDA will be implemented after dataset selection.

# In a real implementation, you would perform EDA here, for example:
# def perform_eda(data):
def main():
    print("Stage 2 - Quick EDA")
    print("EDA will be implemented after dataset selection.")
    print("Expected outputs:")
    print("- figures/")
    print("- eda_summary.md")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
