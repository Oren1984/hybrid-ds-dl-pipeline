# src/stage1_load.py
# This script is responsible for loading the dataset.
# For now, it's a placeholder that indicates where the dataset should be located.

import pandas as pd

# In a real implementation, you would load your dataset here, for example:
# def load_data():
def main():
    # Placeholder loader
    print("Stage 1 - Load")
    print("No dataset connected yet.")
    print("Expected location: data/raw/")

if __name__ == "__main__":
